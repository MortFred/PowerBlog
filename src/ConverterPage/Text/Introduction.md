# Notes on Power Electronics

Power electronics is the discipline within electrical engineering concerned with electrical power **conversion**, and the circuits that make such conversions possible.
Example includes:

-   AC-DC converters (rectifiers)
-   DC-AC converters (inverters)
-   DC-DC transformers
-   Variable Speed Drives (frequency converters)

We'll start our study of power electronics by having a look at rectifiers.

## Rectifier Circuits

The most basic rectifier circuit can be realised with a single switch, in this case a diode.
The diode will only allow current to flow through it when there is a positive voltage bias over it, and thus we can 'block out' the negative-direction voltage signal, and we end up with a single direction voltage output (even though this signal is nowhere near stable, it is at least not bi-directional).
