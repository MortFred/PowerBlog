# Notes on Power Electronics

Power electronics is the discipline within electrical engineering concerned with electrical power **conversion**, and the circuits that make such conversions possible.
Example includes:

-   AC-DC converters (rectifiers)
-   DC-AC converters (inverters)
-   DC-DC transformers
-   Variable Speed Drives (frequency converters)

We'll start our study of power electronics by having a look at rectifiers.
