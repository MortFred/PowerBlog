## Rectifier Circuits

### Single-Phase Half-Wave Rectifier

The most basic rectifier circuit can be realised with a single switch, in this case a diode.
This circuit is often called a **half-wave rectifier** circuit.
The diode will only allow current to flow through it when there is a positive voltage bias over it, and thus we can 'block out' the negative-direction voltage signal, and we end up with a single direction voltage output (even though this signal is nowhere near stable, it is at least not bi-directional).
