### Diode Rectifiers

Diode rectifiers, or naturally commutated rectifiers, are realised using diodes as the switches. As these circuits have no active elements, there is no control system involved.
We will be looking into the two main rectifiers we can make with diodes: [half-wave rectifiers](#half-wave-rectifiers) and [full-wave diode bridge rectifiers](#full-wave-rectifiers).

Then, we will look into diode switching mechanics and how this affects the output.

We will then add circuit elements to the rectifier to smooth out the output signal.

Finally, we will observe the effect of using a three-phase signal in the rectifier.
