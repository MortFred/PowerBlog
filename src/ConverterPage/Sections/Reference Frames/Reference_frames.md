## Reference Frames

In this section we will discuss three _reference frames_ for three-phase voltage signals. These three reference frames are

1. The abc-frame
2. The $\alpha\beta$-frame
3. The dq-frame

Different reference frames allow us to express the same three-fase signal in different ways, mathematically.
Especially the dq-frame is very useful for control of the active- and reactive power produced from a three-phase voltage signal,
and is often used in both motor control and power electronics such as Voltage Source Converters (VSCs).
