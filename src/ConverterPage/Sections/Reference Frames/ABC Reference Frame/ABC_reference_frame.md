### The abc reference frame

The abc reference frame is the default reference frame one first encounters when learning about three phase systems.
This is a three-axis frame, where the three axis are positioned 120$^\circ$ apart in the 2D-plane.

By combining the three phase voltages, we obtain a rotating voltage vector.

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{v_a} + \vec{v_b} + \vec{v_c}
$$
